# Victim-blaiming in Russian Media

<p><b>DISCLAMER FOR THE MARK-UP</b></p>
<p>Data in our corpus is from <i>dd/mm/yyyy</i> to those <i>dd/mm/yyyy</i>. We manually extracted texts from web-pages of Russian-speaking media. Search keyword was <i>iznasilovanie</i> (Russian for 'rape').</p>
<p>markuppers are certain age, gender, background. To minimize subjectivity and to find the 'average' mark-up we would need to have the whole Russia sample of 1800 people <i>(proof/source)</i> which is usually used by sociologists. But we did not have such resources.</p>

<p><b>DISCLAMER FOR VICTIMS & PERPETRAITORS</b></p>
<p>We do not aim to make conclusions on whether the people in the articles told the truth. We do not try to decide how each case should be judged. Our goal is to research the language used in media to describe such cases.</p>

<p><b>DISCLAMER FOR NATIONALITY & RACE & RELIGION</b></p>
<p>We use these factors in our analyses, however, we do not aim to show particular religions and/or nationalities as a cause of what happened. We believe that these characteristics of supposed perpetrators may influence the way the story is portrayed in the news. That is the only reason for us to collect such data.</p>
